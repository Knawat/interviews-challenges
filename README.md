## Interview Challenges

This project will provide simple set of services with [Moleculer](https://moleculer.services/) Framework, with [REDIS](https://redis.io/) caching and [NATs](https://nats.io/) for transportation.

## Functionality:

- User can login & register.
- User can add product in the cart.
- User can get his cart summary.
- docker-compose support

## Backend:

- Elasticsearch as a database.
- NATs messaging system for services transportation.

## Postman Collection

## Build Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start developing with REPL
npm run dev

# Start production
npm start

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Run Prettier
npm run prettier
```

## Run in Docker (production)

### Set environment

- `cp .env.example .env` and make desired changes into .env

### Run in Docker (Development)

1.  Start with docker-compose: `docker-compose up -d`

    It starts all services in separated containers, a Redis server for caching and a [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) reverse proxy. All nodes communicate via NATs transporter.

2.  Open the http://docker-ip:3000
3.  Scale up services

    `docker-compose scale api=3 products=2 auth=2`

## Code Overview

### Dependencies

- [moleculer](https://github.com/moleculerjs/moleculer) - Microservices framework for NodeJS
- [moleculer-web](https://github.com/moleculerjs/moleculer-web) - Official API Gateway service for Moleculer
- [nats](https://github.com/nats-io/node-nats) - [NATS](https://nats.io) transport driver for Moleculer _(optional)_
- [elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js) - [ELASTICSEARCH](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) as database
- [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) - [REDIS](https://redis.io/) caching
- [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) - JWT user autheentication

### Application Structure

- `moleculer.config.js` - Moleculer ServiceBroker configuration file.
- `services/` - This folder contains the services.

## Test

```
$ npm test
```

# How to scale services?
You can use docker compose scale command to scale services. for example,
```
 docker-compose scale products=2
 docker-compose scale auth=2
 docker-compose scale elastic=5
```
# Mention some micro-services specific pattern you used and why?

Project uses [EVERY SERVICE ON A SINGLE NODE](https://moleculer.services/docs/0.13/clustering.html#Microservices-architecture) micro-service architecture to make project scalable. By using this architecture we can scale all services to make system falut tolerant and flexible as there wonâ€™t be many dependency concerns and rolling back changes becomes much easier.
