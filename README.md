## Interview Challenges

This Project will provide simple set of services with [Moleculer](https://moleculer.services/) Framework, with [REDIS](https://redis.io/) caching, and [NATS](https://nats.io/) for transportation.

## Functionality:

- User can log in & register.
- User can add product to the cart.
- User can get his cart summary.
- docker-compose support

## Backend:

- Elasticsearch as a database.
- NATs messaging system for services transportation.

# How to scale cart/product service?

	docker-compose scale products=2
	docker-compose scale auth=2
	docker-compose scale elastic=5

# Mention some micro-services specific pattern you used and why?

project uses [EVERY SERVICE ON A SINGLE NODE](https://moleculer.services/docs/0.13/clustering.html#Microservices-architecture) micro-service architecture to make project scallable. By using this architecture we can scale all services to make system falut tolerant and flexible as there wonâ€™t be many dependency concerns and rolling back changes becomes much easier.
